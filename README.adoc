# Getting Groovy with Gemfire (/ Geode)

This repo has a bunch of projects, examples and experiments with applying the
Groovy language to Gemfire to give extra capabilities, ease of use and ideas for extension.

## Example Groovy Function

Simple use of Groovy to write a Gemfire function.

Allows the optional ignoring of types and the use of Groovy functional dev
for processing data across the distributed system.

## Aggregation

Work on a generified aggregation framework for Geode, using Groovy on the
back end. Uses the same techniques and ideas as the example Groovy function,
but with greater application.


## Document Store

Turn Gemfire into a Document Store a la Mongo etc.

HTTP/ REST interface. Aggregation framework.
