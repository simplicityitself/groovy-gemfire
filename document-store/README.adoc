# A rich, in memory document store

Based on Geode/ Gemfire.

Changes the client model to work in a very similar way to MongoDB etc.

No objects, instead JSON is used exclusively as the document representation
(for now..)

## Query

Uses OQL queries.

## Aggregation

Aggregation is not yet supported...  See the GroovyAggregation module to see if that is changing ...

## Client

Uses HTTP/ REST and also a Muon interface.

This gives :-

* Multi transport (AMQP, HTTP, ZeroMQ)
* Polyglot (Currently Java/ Node.js)
* Request/ response (like HTTP!)
* Streaming updates via a reactive streams (http://reactive-streams.org) interface
 * This is used to expose the geode continuous queries for document updates.
