#Building an Aggregation Framework for Gemfire using Groovy

Gemfire is a powerful distributed data grid. It provides a performant query language and the ability to run rich and deep analytics via Java based function executions.

Potentially missing though, is the ability to quickly write queries that use aggregation operations, such as count.

This talk walsk through using groovy to write functions in a natural and performant way. Next, how to combine with the client side to give a transparent view of an aggregation.

Finally, this capability will be extended into a re-usable aggregation system and optional Groovy DSL
